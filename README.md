# The-Star-Wars-Galaxy

Hello Everyone!

This was a pet project of mine to prep something for the Esri UC Map Gallery. I thought it would be nice to show off something that wasn't work related for once.

To begin, I took advantage of the planets listed here:

Many thanks to those who put the real leg-work in.

The location for each planet was randomly generated within its given grid square. The positions of several main planets were manually adjusted to accomodate their lore.
Their location along a hyperspace lane was also taken into account. However I intentionally did not adjust their position very far for this. Lanes in the Star Wars universe
make more sense to me as being linear with sharp turns, rather than the smooth curved paths seen in most images floating around.

The symbol sizes were derived from the many books I have on my shelf as well as a lot of referrals to Wookiepedia.\

The planet descriptions were grabbed from their respective Wookiepedia pages using the great method invented here:

Long story short, I'm putting the shapefile I've compiled for this project up here for the whole fandom to use and edit to their own content. And yes, this map only includes
worlds from the pre-Disney Expanded Universe. Sorry, Mickey. You can't replace the stories I grew up with.

Known for its humid, twisting jungles, bubbling mud pits, hanging clouds of steam, and a place where the credit was king, Darlyn Boda was a lawless world complementing perfectly the Greater Javin region in which it rested, an area of space negatively publicized for its pirate activity. Although Darlyn Boda fell under Imperial control during the Galactic Civil War, the planet played host to a number of groups, including the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the crime syndicate Black Sun, and the Bounty Hunters' Guild. In 3 ABY, the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM delivered a group of ninety Echo Base refugees from the Battle of Hoth, including Toryn Farr, to Darlyn Boda's large Rebel underground.\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 11.258439226000064, -18.802469304999931 ] } },

The only above-surface settlement on Manaan was the floating Ahto City, built above Hrakert Rift, an abundant source of Kolto. Hiding in the depths of the rift lay a station where the Republic was trying to harvest Kolto at its source, aided by rebellious Selkath who saw the evil of the Sith Empire. This station fell in ruins when a Giant Firaxan Shark believed to be the source of Kolto and Selkath on the planet made the Selkath in the station go mad and rapidly kill the rest of the Crew. Eventually, Revan would find one of the star maps leading to the Star Forge. The map completed other maps found on Kashyyyk, Dantooine, Korriban, and Tatooine. During the Jedi Civil War, both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic attempted to get an upper hand in the war by creating secret deals that would give them more kolto. Since the Selkath preferred to stay neutral, they did not favor the Republic or the Sith, however some rebellious Selkath did. Ultimately, however, the Selkath banned the Sith from Manaan for trying to overthrow the government.\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 16.079968059000066, -11.669022967999979 ] } },

Once a galactic nexus that earned great wealth from its strategic position on hyperspace routes, Taris' importance declined with the discovery of improved trade routes, and the planet rapidly fell into decay with a slow mass migration of its residents across the galaxy. The remainder of the planet's history was wrought with civil disorder and social unrest. As it turned to industry as a means of compensation for its economic troubles, its oceans became polluted, eliminating the planet's main food source.
